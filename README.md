### 2. SVD

Use a matrix with scores from users about items. Then predict the target user score to unevaluated items and recommend the highest estimated scored items.

### 3. Matrix Fatorization

Split the rating matrix which are ratings that user gave to items, into 'user latent matrix' and 'item latent matrix'. First initialize with random values. By using Gradient Descent method, minimize the error and update weight. Recommend the final top n items.
